\ac{OLO} is a basic building block for optimization and machine learning problems. It allows to reduce the design of learning algorithms to simple online algorithms for linear losses.
In particular, \ac{OCO}, stochastic optimization, batch optimization, and (convex) machine learning algorithms can be solved with simple instantiations of \ac{OLO} algorithms.

Yet, some critical issues are currently mostly ignored by theoretical research.
In particular, the adaptation to the norm of the optimal solution is not taken into account in first-order optimization algorithms and the model selection phase is often ignored in theoretical algorithms for machine learning.
In fact, in theoretical works most of the time assumptions are made, for example, on the prior knowledge of the norm of the optimal solution, while in the practical world validation methods remain the only viable approach.

In this paper, we propose to use coin betting as a starting principle, instead of \ac{OLO}. We will prove that an optimal betting algorithm can be used to have optimal guarantees in \ac{OLO}, \ac{OCO} and regularized ERM, proving novel connections between these areas.
